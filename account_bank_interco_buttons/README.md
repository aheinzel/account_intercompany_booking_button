**DISCLAIMER:** This module was autogenerated collaboratively with ChatGPT (GPT‑5 Thinking) as an educational example. Review, test, and adapt before using in production.

## What it does
Adds a button on *Bank Statement Line* to open a wizard that:
- Splits the amount by percentages across selected companies.
- Posts mirrored intercompany moves:
  - Source company: CREDIT Source Expense → DEBIT Intercompany AR (partner = destination company).
  - Destination company: DEBIT Destination Expense (partner = source company) → CREDIT Intercompany AP (partner = source company).
- Links created moves back to the statement line (`interco_move_ids`).
- Optional: attach a file and propagate it to all created moves.
- Copies the original bank line description into the destination company's move chatter.
- Auto-offsets the bank line to a chosen clearing/outstanding account and tries to reconcile it.
